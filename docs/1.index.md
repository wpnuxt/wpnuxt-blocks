## What is @wpnuxt/blocks?

An add-on that can be used alongside the [WPNuxt Core](/docs) package.

It provides a set of vue components to render Gutenberg blocks.

Requires the [wp-graphql-content-blocks](https://github.com/wpengine/wp-graphql-content-blocks) WordPress plugin to be installed and activated on your WordPress site.

## Still under heavy development

At the time of writing this, the @wpnuxt/blocks package is still under heavy development and contains only a few block components like CoreButton and CoreHeading.

As we continue adding new block comonents to the package, we will update the documentation and add more examples.
