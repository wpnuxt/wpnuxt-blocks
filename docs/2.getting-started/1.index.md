## add @wpnuxt/blocks to your Nuxt app

You can install the module to your Nuxt application with one command:

```bash
npx nuxi module add @wpnuxt/blocks
```

However, this will add the module as last module in the list of modules, so you will have to move it above the @wpnuxt/core module to be able to make sure the blocks can be loaded.

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: [
    '@wpnuxt/blocks', // add this module above @wpnuxt/core
    '@wpnuxt/core'
  ],
})
```
